Job searching during Brexit and a Pandemic is a nothing less than a nightmare. Hundreds of applications later and you wonder if all your applications were actually sent straight to the void.

In order to make this process easier for myself I decided to automate the process somewhat. The first step was to find a bulk list of company emails. CrunchBase came to mind. With a free trial they allow you to search for a list of companies against filters like date founded, number of employees etc.

Unfortunately, that's where the free trial ends. In order to export your now filtered list you need to "upgrade" your free trial and pay about Â£250. No thanks. To get around this I first highlighted all the companies whose emails I wanted and copied that information into notepad. At first I tried MS Word but discovered that notepad is significantly faster for inputting large amounts of text.
