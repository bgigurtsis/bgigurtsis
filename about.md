I'm Billy Gigurtsis, an IT professional from London, England. My career started around two years ago training as a desktop support engineer. Since then I’ve expanded my experience through multiple contracts in various IT support roles. I hope to transition away from IT support into infrastructure within the next year. To this end, I have been upskilling by learning CentOS / RedHat, to take the Redhat Systems Administrator Certification and become certified. I also learnt GitHub and AWS, which this website is built and hosted upon.

I love watching documentary films. I love learning about everything from obscure social movements to what it’s like to live in the Taiga. Unfortunately, my ADHD makes it very hard for me to get through books. I’ve found documentaries to be a great way of getting around my ADHD and learn about new things. Please feel free to browse my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/icy100/) profile  (or shoot me [a message](https://www.bgigurtsis.com/contact/) ) for a list of my favourite films.

Another interest of mine is therapy/counselling. I’ve personally benefited so much from participating in therapy as a client. The way of thinking through problems that a therapist engages in is something that attracts me and my goal, with a lot more life experience, is to become a practising therapist and help people like I was helped.

Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy my website and please [get in touch](https://www.bgigurtsis.com/contact/) if you have any questions - or just want to chat!
