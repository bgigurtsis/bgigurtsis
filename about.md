I'm Billy Gigurtsis, an IT professional from London, England. My career started around two years ago training as a desktop support engineer. Since then I’ve expanded my experience through multiple contracts in various IT support roles. I hope to transition away from IT support into infrastructure within the next year. To this end I have been upskilling by learning CentOS / RedHat to take the Redhat Systems Administrator Certification and become certified. I also learnt GitHub and AWS, which this website is built and hosted upon.

During non-COVID times I love to volunteer. I have the time and the skills so it makes sense to use those to help where I can. Recently I travelled to northern Sweden to help integrate youth back into society. I also participate as a mentor in my local 'CoderDojo'. Children come to learn about programming through `Scratch`. You can read about the rest of my volunteering roles on my [CV](https://www.bgigurtsis.com/CV).

I'm also an avid documentary watcher. I love learning about everything from obscure social movements to what it’s like to live in the Taiga. Unfortunately my ADHD makes it very hard for me to get through books. I’ve found documentaries to be a great way to absorb new information without straining my attention span. Please feel free to browse my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/icy100/) profile for a list of my favourites.

Another interest of mine is therapy/counselling. I’ve personally benefited so much from participating in therapy as a client. The way of thinking through problems that a therapist engages in is something that attracts me and my goal, with a lot more life experience, is to become a practising therapist and help people like I was helped.

I hope you enjoy my website and please get in [touch](https://www.bgigurtsis.com/contact/) if you have any questions - or just want to chat!
