By default in many Jekyll themes (including the one I [use](https://github.com/johno/pixyll)) the homepage is where your blog posts are. I like having the homepage and the blog separate. My [homepage](https://www.bgigurtsis.com/) informs users about the website's function and provides links to different parts, including the blog.

Because Jekyll sets everything up for you, setting a custom homepage is not that easy, nor could I find it in the Jekyll documentation. After some experimentation and research this is the process that I used:

By default, the index.html in the root directory contains code for pagination. pagination makes it so that after a certain number of posts the rest get moved onto the next page. We need this code for our blog posts. The first step in making a new homepage is to move this pagination code into its folder. I moved `./index.html` -> `./blog/index.html`. Why I did this will become clear later.

I just moved my index page into a different folder, however, Jekyll needs an index page to build without failing. With Jekyll, the index page can be either Markdown or HTML. I wanted a stripped-down blog post as a homepage so I changed the name of the post I wanted to use to  `index.md`.

This presents further challenges as each post uses a post `layout` which dictates things to include my default. For blog posts this include how long it takes to read that post and the date. To remove this, I created a new layout inside `./_layouts` and removed the date and time to read:

```html
<!--<div class="post-header mb2">
  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <span class="post-meta small">
  </span>
</div>

<article class="post-content">
  {{ content }}
</article>

{% if site.show_sharing_icons %}
  {% include share_buttons.html %}
{% endif %}

{% if site.show_post_footers %}
  {% include post_footer.html %}
{% endif %}

{% if site.disqus_shortname %}
  <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var disqus_shortname  = '{{ site.disqus_shortname }}';
    var disqus_identifier = '{{ page.id }}';
    var disqus_title      = {{ page.title | jsonify }};

    (function() {
      var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
      dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
      (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
  </script>
  <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
{% endif %}

{% if site.facebook_comments %}
  <div class="fb-comments" data-href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" data-width="100%" data-numposts="{{ site.facebook_comments_number }}"></div>
{% endif %}

{% if site.show_related_posts %}
  <h3 class="related-post-title">{{ site.text.post.related_posts | default: "Related Posts" }}</h3>
  {% for post in site.related_posts %}
    <div class="post ml2">
      <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}" class="post-link">
        <h4 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h4>
        <p class="post-summary">{{ post.summary }}</p>
      </a>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
{% endif %}-->
```
The folder structure for my website looks like this now:

```
website
├── _config.yml
├── index.md (welcome post)
├── blog
       ├── index.html (paginate code)
│
├── _posts
       ├── post1.md
       ├── post2.md
       ├── post3.md
       ├── post4.md
       ├── post5.md
```

I then need to tell the Jekyll pagination plugin where to look for my index.html containing pagination code (./blog/index.html). This is done through my _config.yml, adding this line of code:

```
paginate_path: "/blog/page:num"
```
This not only tells pagination to look in /blog/ for index.html but also provides the format of bgigurtsis.com/blog/page2, page3, page4 etc.

So, pagination now has its path set to bgigurtsis.com/blog/page. However,  it will still go back to bgigurtsis.com when clicking `Newer` to navigate back to the first page of blog posts. To correct this I had to change this line of code:
```
     <a class="pagination-item" href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">{{ site.text.pagination.newer | default: "Newer" }}</a>#
```
to this
```
     <a class="pagination-item" href="{{ "/blog" | relative_url }}">{{ site.text.pagination.newer | default: "Newer" }}</a>
```

And that's it! It was quite involved getting this changed when there's not much documentation on it but it was very satisfying making it work in the end.
